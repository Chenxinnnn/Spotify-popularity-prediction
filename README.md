# Motivation

The initiative for the project is that, from the perspective ofa record company, we'd like to make a well-informed
decision about potential investment in new songs. We'lllook into the features a song possesses to predict its
potential for popularity, and consequently, the likelihood ofgenerating profits that justify the investments.

# What we did
1. EDA
In this step, we will try to explore what a popular song is like. We define popular songs as those ranked at
20% top in popularity score. We will explore how different features are distributed and the envolution along
time.

2. Modeling
We will try to pipeline a model that will predict whether a song would be popular based on its features.
Possible steps may involve:
- preprocessing: data cleaning, outlier analysis, colinearity analysis
- feature engineering: feature selection, manipulation, create new features
- models: try different models, customize sklearn models
- performance evaluation

3. Case study
Understand possible reasons that the model is not performing well
